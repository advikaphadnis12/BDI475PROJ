https://www.yelp.com/biz/university-group-champaign,University Group,1,"Dear University Group:<br><br>I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss the deductions made from my security deposit for my tenancy at 1107 S Fourth, Unit 3 during the last academic year.<br><br>Upon reviewing the itemized list of deductions, I noted the following charges:<br><br>Paint and repair: $400<br>Cleaning: $880<br>Item Removal: $350<br>Carpet cleaning: $205<br><br>The total deductions amount (1835 dollars) is a substantial portion of my security deposit. My roommate and I have not caused any damage to the property nor have we left a mess for you to clean. As a tenant, I am entitled to transparency regarding these charges. I request the provision of receipts for each service that was allegedly carried out. This is not only to verify the costs but also to ensure that these services were conducted by legitimate and operational businesses.<br><br>Having consulted with my school&#39;s legal services, I&#39;ve been informed that I have the right to request and review these receipts. To expedite the resolution of this matter, I propose two options:<br><br>1, Kindly provide me with the respective receipts for the aforementioned services. (I&#39;ll send it to my attorney to validate the legitimacy of the company and its service)<br>2, Alternatively, I am willing to accept a refund of 80% of my original security deposit, and we can consider the matter resolved.<br><br>Should I not receive the requested receipts or the proposed refund within a reasonable timeframe, I want to inform you that I am prepared to escalate the matter. While I genuinely hope to resolve this amicably, I will not hesitate to seek legal recourse through my school&#39;s attorney to ensure my rights as a tenant are upheld.<br><br>I trust that we can come to a satisfactory resolution promptly.

UG told her and her roommates to vacate IMMEDIATELY so they could fix it, but offered no compensation for them to stay in a hotel.

This is beyond a small, resolvable pest issue. She sent the group photos of this, and they once again acted as if this is normal.

Big mistake.<br><br>When I got the apartment, it was disgusting. I was told that it had been cleaned prior to my move in date, which was an obvious lie. There was hair and dirt in the showers and bathroom sinks, the carpets were disgusting, the paint on the walls that was once white is a now brownish scum color in most places. There were I&#39;d like to say about three dozen nail holes in each room from previous tenants. Cleaning the whole apartment when first moving in was a huge ordeal.

We couldn&#39;t figure out why we felt how we did until one night after sitting on the couch I started to pass out and the CO2 alarm goes off. Turns out, a pipe wasn&#39;t installed right on the hot water heater and Carbon Monoxide had been leaking into the apartment, resulting in both of us having to go to the hospital at about 2 am for CO2 poisoning resulting in huge bills. I&#39;m still wondering why the alarm never went off earlier...<br><br>Now comes the &#34;best&#34; part. Moving out. I cleaned that apartment top to bottom, and was quite impressed that it could actually look pretty good once it had a deep cleaning. But of course, I didn&#39;t think to take pictures during my move out. So, I turned in my keys I had been given and forgot all about it until three months later I get a security deposit check and about $700 in &#34;cleaning&#34; bills. I knew this was BS. I contacted the UG and was met with a very rude response after describing my situation. After that I decided to try to contact the cleaning group &#34;We Clean Plus&#34; which has no search results on the internet. I was met with the response: &#34;We cannot discuss your invoice with you&#34;.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/university-group-champaign,University Group,1,"I leased with University group for my senior year of college at the Arbor apartments in 2018.<br><br>The location right across from the Ike and the relatively low price was definitely a plus, but University Group&#39;s behavior and treatment of its tenants made me realize why it was so cheap. <br><br>First off, the apartment complex itself is a nice location with lots of vegetation which I thoroughly enjoyed. The location is also great, but the buildings are in need of an some upgrades and fast.<br><br>The buildings are very old and just seem to be having more and more issues. My friend who lives in the complex this year (and has for several years) was having issues just this month with leaking. Whenever his upstairs neighbor would use the toilet or shower you could hear water cascading down through the walls and it would leak into his kitchen which is frankly disgusting. His downstairs neighbor was also affected by this. University Group took out his wall and fixed the issue within a little over a week, but it does just show how old the building is.<br><br>Now for my experience. I moved into my apartment in August of 2019 and was initially very pleased with the place. My largest complaint at the time was that the way my kitchen was set up in such a way that I couldn&#39;t open up my fridge door all the way and there was no way to rearrange the small kitchen to make this possible. However, after getting into October I found I started needing to use heat in my apartment. Lo and behold, my furnace did not work. I thought this would be an easy fix, but I called maintenance and they told me it was not an issue on their end and to call Ameren to come inspect it. An employee from Ameren came over and frankly told me that my heater was broken and that &#34;those guys typically have no idea what the hell they&#39;re talking about.&#34; <br><br>I called maintenance again the next day and they thought my pilot light was out. By now it was in November and getting very cold in the apartment. A different group of maintenance workers came in a few days later and informed me that I was to wait &#34;two to three weeks&#34; while they ordered a new part for the furnace because it was out of production and they had to get it specially ordered and manufactured. In the mean time, they gave me a single space heater to keep warm well into December by their own admission. Two to three weeks went by and by this point I was calling UGroup several times a week asking about when the shipment was expected to arrive to which they always found a way to avoid the question and at one point even admitted that several people in the complex were in the same boat as I and that I should stop complaining (see my previous comment about the building being very old).<br><br>This all culminated with me contracting pneumonia which is of little surprise since my apartment was routinely under 40°F for a period of several weeks. I was lucky enough to have friends who let me sleep at their place and recover. At this point the apartment was uninhabitable and I called Champaign Neighborhood services to come inspect the apartment. They agreed with me and my apartment was to be condemned unless UGroup provided me with heat since space heaters (no matter how many) do not qualify. <br><br>After this UGroup sent maintenance in and immediately installed mounted space heaters that skirted city codes and technically qualified as heating. It was definitely an improvement as I could now live there, but the heaters were woefully inefficient and my electric bill in the winter routinely came to close to $200 for a single bedroom apartment. I felt like I was being punished for reporting that my apartment had no eat during the Illinois winter.<br><br>I hope they at least got a real furnace for the next tenant and from what I can tell these myserious parts they had specifically manufactured never came because I had to use the mounted space heaters for the rest of my lease.<br><br>Oh and another note, for whatever reason an FBI agent with PTSD (according to signs he, and later UGroup, put around the complex) had moved into the apartment complex during the Spring and was harassing other tenants. Every time someone shut a door or was moving laundry I could hear him screaming and swearing at people. This happened multiple times a day and I was often woken up on weekend hearing him threatening people.<br> He was luckily at the other side of my building, but my friend (who I mentioned earlier) was living right across from him and was terrified to leave his apartment. Now I don&#39;t know what laws there are about choosing who you can lease apartments to, but it seems like a terrible idea putting someone with PTSD in an apartment complex with college students right across from the Ikenberry commons with thousands of students.",,,70,,11/10/2019,,zcSPYVCsGFqnkSDZ0yH1EA,Nick C.,0,1,"Champaign, IL",eWVWqNHZ3bggbm2zY9bSfw,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=eWVWqNHZ3bggbm2zY9bSfw
https://www.yelp.com/biz/university-group-champaign,University Group,1,"I put off writing this review for a while, but it would be a shame to see anyone else go through what I had to. <br><br>I signed a sublease agreement with the University Group in December 2018 and lived there for a mere 72 hours before discovering it was rodent infested. I asked prior to signing the lease if there were any pest concerns due to another apartment problem I recently had and being immunocompromised; I was assured there were no pest concerns. When I first moved in, I discovered a large amount of droppings all over the kitchen and in the cabinets... I was assured that mice have not been a problem within the building, yet again. So, I decided to set up mouse traps... Within a couple of hours, i caught multiple mice. This continues to happen over the mere 72 hours I lived there. Not only did I catch mice in my apartment, but I heard them scurrying throughout my kitchen cabinets. I ended up staying at a hotel for a week until I managed to find a new apartment. Whenever I contacted the leasing office, I had various responses that never once apologized for my inconvenience or even addressed that there was a legitimate rodent problem....Amongst the avoidant responses I received was one where I was told that I &#34;need to realize it is winter in Central IL and mice happen&#34;... So basically the University Group telling me to get over it... Don&#39;t get me wrong, I understand that mice happen but I don&#39;t understand how it&#39;s possible to catch 10 mice in 72 hours if there isn&#39;t an issue that needs to be addressed ... <br><br>On the second day of living there, I was assured there were absolutely no possible entry points for the mice within my unit. I moved the oven and discoverd a GAPING HOLE IN THE WALL. There was a container of mouse poison already there, so the University Group was aware of this hole existing back there. I message them... They respond as if they had no clue. I went back and forth with The University Group for months because this issue was not resolved and mouse droppings continued to be scattered all over every kitchen surface while I still had the sublease. Never once did they own up to the fact that THEY were responsible for mice coming in through a giant hole in my wall... <br><br>TL;DR.....Over the course of less than 1 week, I caught 10 mice and still heard them within the cabinets and walls. The University Group did nothing to help. <br><br>The ONLY redeemable thing about The University Group was their maintenance department.

Can you imagine how terrified I was at that moment? There are 3 men in my living room and I was in bed. This is RUDE! They have my number and email. Why don&#39;t they notify me in advance?!

https://www.yelp.com/biz/university-group-champaign,University Group,1,"I moved in to my apartment on August 23. When I opened the door the stench was overpowering. Honestly, i sprinted to the window to start airing it out. It smelled like the last tenant was someone with 25 cats. And that was nothing compared to the fact it was so so dirty. Obviously, no one had even looked in the apartment (I found things of the last tenant&#39;s still in the cabinets) or cleaned anything. There were even stains on the walls. To top it all off, I had no power in the apartment when I moved in. <br><br>When I called, the realty company basically told me that it was a problem with Ameren and not their problem. Now, I had specifically set up my power utilities prior to move-in as instructed by U-Group. I moved in on a Saturday afternoon. I called the realty company repeatedly about the problem, and tried to tell them that I HAD set up my power. Ameren&#39;s office is only open weekdays so I couldn&#39;t get a hold of them either. I spent Saturday night in a smelly apartment with no power.<br><br>On Sunday, I waited until 5pm and after I was still not getting any help from U-Group, I paid for a hotel room. Monday morning, I was thankfully able to get through to a very nice woman at Ameren. She told me what I knew all along- that my power HAD been set up and that power had always been &#34;flowing&#34; to my apartment. She told me to call my landlord. Near tears, I explained to her that U-Group basically refused to come help me, and could she please talk me through how to fix it myself. She explained to me how to go to the back of the building and find the meter for my apartment. All it took was a flip of the meter on the exterior of the building. The woman was surprised that I had to do it, as the meters are the responsibility of the building owner. I now had power. No thanks to U-Group.<br><br>When I called again and tried to vent my frustration, I was basically brushed off (would not reimburse me for the hotel room) but they did send a maintenance guy to fix my (broken) oven. The maintenance man was very nice and told me the down-low: the previous tenant had refused to move out after his lease ended, and when they finally got rid of him, they found piles of garbage everywhere. Long story short: they let me move into a disgusting apartment recently vacated by a hoarder that was smelly and dirty and had no power. To top that off this has been the worst customer service experience of my life.<br><br>Did I mention this apartment is $513 a month not including utilities??? I also filed a report with the U of I housing department to try and discourage other students from ever renting with them. I highly recommend any other company (I&#39;ve lived with both Bankier and Roland before, they actually care about their tenants).",,,70,,9/6/2014,,ZqISoL-fSVN4duNeQ2BaCw,Laura M.,9,3,"Naperville, IL",e65Q_fVopmAcwYgxyMQcyw,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=e65Q_fVopmAcwYgxyMQcyw
https://www.yelp.com/biz/university-group-champaign,University Group,1,"Be extremely wary of leasing with UG, in my experience they are one of the worst, if not THE WORST leasing agencies on campus. <br><br>My lease with UG officially ended last month and I have nothing good to say about my lease with them.<br><br>1. I will reiterate what others have said, while they are kind to you when signing the lease initially, they give little to no consideration for the post-lease signing period. Don&#39;t fall for their trickery!<br><br>2. Upon move in, the entire apartment was filthy. There was a copious amount of dust, scratches all over the floors, the fridge and cabinets were clearly not cleaned and had some sticky residue built up inside, the stove and oven had not been cleaned either... worst of all, while the unit had plenty of windows, more than half of them couldn&#39;t be opened. We cleaned the apartment entirely ourselves as the management didn&#39;t respond, and eventually we called to request the cleaning of the blinds (which had been grayed with years of dust built up) and the fixing of the leaking bathroom sink. They hardly cleaned the blinds and the sink remained leaky the entire year.<br><br>3. Maintenance: I&#39;ve unfortunately had to call maintenance for many different causes, most often for the plumbing and heating during the winter. The rudest awakening was returning from winter break to see that someone had come into our apartment and opened several windows and tampered with the fire alarm. Nothing seemed to be missing, and I suspected it was the maintenance as they have previously entered our unit without notice or leaving a note that they had been there. The windows could not be closed and my roommate and I dealt with a few days of freezing cold blasts from the outside, including in our bedroom until the office opened again after the weekend. I called UG and they said to call the cops because &#34;it couldn&#39;t have been them&#34;... doubtful. Second worst time was when I came back after a few weeks of being away in the summer and found that the toilet was not flushing, I called maintenance everyday for nearly a week until they came to fix it, imagine not being able to stay in your own apartment because the toilet wasn&#39;t functioning for that amount of time. I wasn&#39;t about to pay for the plumber as these basic fees are already included in my lease. Finally, third worst was when I awoke to the sound of a plumber who had entered without notice and was tampering with something in our bathroom one morning around 9am. I had neither called them or heard any knocks (I am a very light sleeper). Pretty sure these intrusions are illegal. <br><br>4. For the first month of our lease, we were new to apartments and my roommate went to the office and dropped off the check for the next month of rent. The clerk there claimed to review the check and said it was fine. However she had forgotten to sign it and the clerk simply let the  rent become overdue as the check was invalid, they didn&#39;t contact us to notify this and then charged a late fee of $50. Completely rude and inconsiderate.<br><br>5. I finally received my security deposit, only to see that they took nearly $300 for &#34;painting&#34; and over $100 for cleaning. We cleaned our unit thoroughly; it was 10 times better than the state it was in when we moved in. We did nothing to the walls and there should not be a charge for painting, this is not included in the contact. A fine example of campus agencies trying to rip off poor college students. I am waiting to call about this but apparently &#34;their manager is out of the office and they&#39;ll call back at their earliest convenience&#34;... yeah right, I will have to visit the office myself sometime to get any money back.<br><br>Lastly, I would like to advise prospective leasees with UG to rethink signing, even if the unit you&#39;re looking at is cheap.. pay a bit more for better service and a better experience.",,,70,,9/8/2016,,Zr-5PvlpfqPntO9H9XzNvQ,E M.,0,12,"Chicago, IL",DRYzd8G2flvpOWcd8-r1Jg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DRYzd8G2flvpOWcd8-r1Jg

https://www.yelp.com/biz/university-group-champaign,University Group,1,"When I received the apartment the entire place was a mess, even though they were supposed to have cleaned it before I moved in. Paint was chipping, window blinds were grey with dirt (they are supposed to be white), the carpet was filled with hair and even had some jewelry and cat toys. The heater was completely chipping, and dropping paint flakes into the carpet. I ended up cleaning the whole thing myself despite the fact that the reason I moved in late was because they said they would be cleaning the apartments before move in. At the end of May, 3 months before my lease ended they contacted me about replacing the carpet with a wooden floor. I was out of town for a few days when they did this, and when I came back, all my things had been basically thrown into the kitchen, completely messed up, and there was dust all over my bedsheets, the floor, everything. Again, I ended up cleaning this myself. It is now September and I just got only about half my security deposit back with charges for carpet cleaning, apartment cleaning, and painting the walls at move out...when there was no carpet at the time I moved out, I had never once stuck anything on the walls of the apartment, and I left the floor much cleaner than I had received it both at move in, as well as after my carpeted floor was replaced. When I moved in there was colored tape on the living room windows in the shape of a sun or something, and I couldn&#39;t get it out at all, so at move out I had put black chart paper to cover it up...which still resulted in the apartment looking much neater and cleaner than the windows had been when I moved in. I even wiped down the window blinds, making them look much whiter than they had been at move in. <br><br>I contacted the university group about my security deposit refund and was told that I would be emailed to talk about it.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/university-group-champaign,University Group,1,"The University Group maintenance staff was great. They were quick to respond to a roof leak issue and cordial in demeanor. However, I cannot say the same for the managing staff. After the first roof leak everything in the apartment was great. Then a week later, a new storm and a new leak. They &#34;fixed&#34; the roof leak again and replaced the bedroom carpet. The managing staff assured me that it would not happen again and that the maintenance staff was doing everything they could to fix the problem. A week later, the exact same roof leak during weekend midnight rainstorm. Tried calling the maintenance number and someone told me they would come out to fix the problem ASAP. No one came. I was pretty fed up at this point so I called the city monday morning to come and inspect the apartment for mold and any other violations. Right after the city inspection, I get an email that this property changed hands to a new property management company. So I&#39;m sitting there with 1/4&#34; water in my living room and no one to call because I didn&#39;t know who to call. So I finally put two and two together and realized that University Group was trying to fill/rent as many apartments as they could before handing this property over to another management company (which is why I got a slightly cheaper rate). Any extra maintenance/repairs (that would have fixed my roof) would have cost too much so they essentially stonewalled me until they could divest the property. I would throw in a few expletives here because of how much sleep and time I lost during that one month, but I&#39;m guessing that is frowned upon.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/university-group-champaign,University Group,1,"Since my sophomore year, I have been a tenant with the University Group. Overall. I find myself very unhappy with their service. <br>Yes, their apartments are cheap- they&#39;re also rather dirty and old. (When they say they clean the apartment before you move in...they don&#39;t really. The first time I moved in, there was a wrap around the toilet seat that said &#34;cleaned&#34; but there were bits of old throw up all over the seat). <br>Their apartments are also probably in the best locations around campus (close to the quad). <br>It ends up being a trade-off between a landlord you trust and a cheap apartment in a good locale. <br>Several instances that really upset me in my time (3 years) with U Group not including my toilet seat cover story:<br>- I signed a contract with them to transfer apartments after the summer was over and upon my return from summer break, BEFORE MY LEASE HAD ENDED all of my roommate and my things had been completely cleaned out.  They admitted that it was their mistake and &#34;reimbursed&#34; us for a fraction of what everything they took cost (clothes, TV, lights, desks, cleaning supplies, dishware, etc...), and that was only after constant in-person and phone badgering for about a month.  <br>- This happened a few times, maybe three times; I would place a maintenance request in August when I got back to school, and no one would show up unless I called again and again. <br>- They do this thing where they show your apartment (which is fine!) but they do it at weird hours of the day with no warning. One October morning  I woke up at 10 am to a tall man standing in my bedroom doorway with about 3 other people by his side. (I&#39;m just saying, they could call or something right before they get there; they have all of our numbers on the leases- and, its fking 10 am.)<br>- This past summer, when I called the office to ask when our official transfer agreement was finalized before school started (I&#39;m from California, so its a bit of a hassle when summer rolls around to deal with apt stuff) and at first they told me they would tell me in a week. A week turned into two weeks, turned into the next month. As you can imagine, it gets frustrating because I have to buy my plane tickets- when I eventually told them about my situation with the plane tickets, the lady that I was talking to told me that I needed to be patient, and that I needed to give them a chance blah blah and then HUNG UP ON ME. (I think ALL OF SUMMER is a pretty good &#34;chance&#34;. I wasn&#39;t able to buy my plane ticket back to school until about the second week of August.)<br>- There seems to be a lack of communication within the employees in the office. And I say this completely neutrally. They &#34;lose&#34; documents very easily. One of the summers I sublet my room to another girl, and U Group complained that she wasn&#39;t &#34;technically&#34; on the lease, even though previous to subletting another employee told me that it would be fine.<br>- This happened to my roommate: U Group called and told us that they didnt recieve rent from one of the girls in i think September last year (that would be my roommate), which was strange because on my roommates online bank statements, the check was shown as cashed. This problem, I remember, took a while to sort out as well.  Even after my roommate physically walked over to the office with her computer in hand and an online scan of the cashed check. <br>Pros: relatively cheap apartments and locations very close to main campus. <br>Cons: Management that could use some improvement.

All in all University group is cheap but your are getting exactly what you paid for, ugly not well maintained apartments. When we moved in the renovations they promised were not even started. There was no furniture other than an office chair that seemed to have been thrown out multiple times and brought back. There was a folding chair and tv that was it. The floors were disgusting. The walls were full of holes and also disgusting. The vanities were very old and also nasty. The bathrooms are still very disgusting, especially the tub. They sent people to clean but I think it was cleaner before they showed up because there was really no difference in what they did. OH and I almost forgot to mention that we have been here since september and it is now March and I have emailed Maintenance about an animal that lives in our walls and ceilings. The maintenance crew came in once and set rat poison in an area the animal has no access to and it turns out it is a squirrel so I do not know why they have this rat poison out. I have contacted them helplessly through phone calls and maintenance reports and I think they are just ignoring it at this point. The service sucks all in all.
