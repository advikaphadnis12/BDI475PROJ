https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-one-ann-arbor,The One,5,"The One Ann Arbor is the best place to live as a student in Ann Arbor. The houses and townhomes are spacious, modern, and comfortable, with porches, yards, and parking spaces.  The amenities are amazing, with one of the largest resort-style pools in Ann Arbor student housing.  The staff is friendly and helpful, and the maintenance team is quick and efficient.  The private shuttle service is convenient and reliable, and it takes you to campus or downtown in minutes.  I highly recommend The One to anyone looking for a great student neighborhood living experience!","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zxXQKsv1GbOdvsIsP05cWg/180s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2dxjJwl6q4lTNFOUjYbgHg/180s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8LwYtIYnAXbmrSWgBguygg/180s.jpg",4 photos,3,"Hi Shad, thank you so much for the great review! We are happy to hear you are enjoying the amenities and experience provided by The One.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-one-ann-arbor,The One,1,"I was considering one of these apartments until I mentioned it in front of some current residents. My friend lives in one of these apartments and he said there are several residents who have not had heat the entire time they have lived there. To add insult to injury it has been below freezing outside and management keeps sending emails to the residents to make sure they keep their thermostats above 64 degrees to keep the pipes from freezing - but the thermostat won&#39;t get above 60 degrees! <br><br>The residents open maintenance requests but those get closed without any work being done so that they can say they are resolving maintenance requests in a timely manner. <br><br>Other residents report problems with their electrical, and those residents have their maintenance requests closed with the advice to &#34;plug in fewer items.&#34; <br><br>The shuttles that they tell you will get you to and from campus every day were not running most of last year so the residents have to catch a ride on the bus on the main road of property.<br><br>These are brand new apartments and you pay a premium to live there. It doesn&#39;t sound like you are getting your money&#39;s worth.",,,3,"Hi Royal, thank you for the feedback! We have not had any reports of residents not having heat in their apartment. We complete quarterly inspections of all apartments on the property to ensure all spaces and features are in top-quality, working condition. Our shuttle service of three shuttles runs Monday - Saturday with late night &amp; grocery store runs. We do not require premiums for a standard lease at The One, only select locations that residents are able to choose from. I see you are not in our system, but we would love to have you stop in so we can show you all of the reasons residents love living at The One! Feel free to reach out to us directly at leasing@theoneannarbor or (855) 347-2170!",2/16/2023,,uA57yGxvp6WQWE6RckeY9A,Royal M.,0,,"MI, MI",wFpd-Wy3WwXxzWUiTNzGVw,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=wFpd-Wy3WwXxzWUiTNzGVw
https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-one-ann-arbor,The One,1,"DO NOT LIVE HERE. Over the phone to tell you want you want to hear to get you to sign then change it up when it&#39;s time to move in, &#34;lose&#34; your lease so you can&#39;t move in until three months later, and have you move in in the middle of the month yet still try to charge you full months rent. They blame all their problems on &#34;corporate&#34; and &#34;the city&#34;. They take advantage of young college students because they think they don&#39;t know any better. AND TO TOP IT OFF, the lady in the office called me a racial slur as I was leaving. They also have all type of creatures and bugs running around in the apartments along with mold and broken appliances that they won&#39;t fix.",,First to Review,3,,11/15/2021,,Zd2Hi-L3YjXX-MbVQlPYtQ,Samuel S.,0,,"Ann Arbor, MI",NtXBB2ARd-v6GSmK0GrhfA,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NtXBB2ARd-v6GSmK0GrhfA
