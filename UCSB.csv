https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-loop-apartments-isla-vista-3,The Loop Apartments,1,"Sister location to ICON Apt. so on both, be prepared to redline unenforceable non-expense fines out of the lease like CIVIL NOT TENANT noise fees $250-$500 per occurrence per roommate though you have no control over who your roommates or whatever floormates drop by your suite. The lease allows 20 people over so they can attempt to PROFIT off civil noise complaints that any call to police across the street typically resolve.  Also, bait and switch on the lease signing bonus of $500 though it&#39;s listed on the actual lease.  They also don&#39;t apply rent as you direct on their portal.  They apply rent payments to UNENFORCEABLE non-out of pocket expense &#34;lease violations&#34; first so your rent ILLEGALLY appears to be late every day a result. LAW MAX =5%. Move-in condition has many things missing or damaged that they already billed tenant that moved out and if you don&#39;t report out on the move-in sheet, they will attempt to profit off new tenant tho they never replaced or repaired from the last tenant.   TVs did not work, remotes missing.  These are easy things that should have been checked especially on the expensive Suites before move in rather than making us wait until the maintenance person returns from being sick?  My roommates and I were billed for the replacement of a perfecting working microwave that we had requested the handle be repaired.  $1600 for a furnished 8x10 bedroom keeps occupancy low so they make up the loss in a sheet long list of items.  Garbage overflowing on roof deck daily.  Bait and switch advertised security guard on website w/o concessions which I see they removed from the website now so just the office phone # in the lobby rather than a person to receive parcels so many of ours went missing as they are left unsecured in the lobby until someone from office collects them.  Lobby attendant moves to rooftop office after parent dropoff weekend. Would be nice for instacart , Grubhub deliveries &amp; noise complaints if they reinstated but not happening with a $1,000 per occurrence profit on the 65 units.  Small mailbox is shared.  Water service required as it tastes too salty.  Apartment Key FOB is nice.  Most units don&#39;t have full-size refrigerators.  No ice makers or trays.  Maintenance repairs are done fairly promptly.  Noise is mild.  Garbage chute is too small. Wifi is ok. Location is central but a homeless park is across the street.<br> Need floor lamps and no overhead lighting.  Some fun organized activities. There is no TV on the roof deck as advertised on the gallery photos.  Bring extra long shower curtain or water gets on the bathroom floor.  No Airconditioning or cooling fan only heat and the summer months are unbearable.  Windows are not double-paned.  Though a room with a window was unoccupied all year, they refused my repeated request to move within the unit. They will not share security video of guest coming out of your apartment ringing doorbells so you can make sure they never return as they want them to return as you guessed it another attempt at $250 fee x 4 in the unit.  Parking is tough.  The free stand up paddleboard they offer is too heavy to carry to the beach.  Thankfully Isla Vista Tenant Association is available to advise inexperienced students from being intimidated by these large corporate conglomerates.",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kImA0QWLyPiPz6bKtG6Cgg/300s.jpg,1 photo,21,Thank you William for your honest feedback.

Some of the common areas like the rooftop and lounge could use some upgrading.  Don&#39;t get me wrong they are nice, but some new tables and chairs (maybe even a couch) could be brought in.  There once was gaming equipment but now that isn&#39;t there- I feel like that would be a nice thing to bring back.  <br><br>If you&#39;re looking for something with a lot of privacy, unfortunately, this is not the place BUUUTTT if you are coming in with friends to sign a lease together then you don&#39;t have much to worry.  The partition walls do not reach the entirety of the wall, but you still have your our space for the most part.  <br><br>This may be an expensive place to live, but If you calculate all the costs of buying a bed, desk, paying for utilities, etc. it would be much more so I&#39;m glad that The Loop has almost about everything residents need.  Electricity is not included but they are awesome for having solar panels on the 5th floor to lower the cost of those bills haha.",,,21,"Hi Brian, thank you for your review.

If you check the address of this location and The Loop - Coastal Ridge it is the same.<br><br>CAUTION!<br><br>Living here isn&#39;t bad. It&#39;s safe and relatively new and clean. Grossly overpriced, not much furnishings just a bed desk and wardrobe. No couch, the fridge is a mini fridge and they expect 3 people to fit their stuff in it. Even though the building was built recently the insides are already deteriorating, the floors are scuffed up and the management doesn&#39;t do a good job of cleaning. Typical college lifestyle, loud on the weekends and the hallways smell of weed.<br><br>The reason why I gave this place one star is that despite a mediocre living experience the management team is NIGHTMARE to deal with. They just sit in the lobby doing nothing and look rude and bored everytime you ask them for anything. I lived there for 3 months and they were unable to provide me with a mailbox key. When I finally moved out and found a subleaser they lied to me  and did not uphold promises on multiple occasions. Forcing my subleaser to move to a different unit and saying it was my fault even though I did everything they asked of me. They ask you to fill paperwork and turn in your key and then turn it around and say since I did that they have a right to move my apartment. They also charged me a $350 subleasing fee even though they wouldn&#39;t give my subleaser the apartment. And when you try to reach them via phone or email they don&#39;t respond even if they have nothing to do.<br><br>If you are the type of person who doesn&#39;t ever need to talk to management for issues and just needs a place to live then The Loop is fine. But if you plan on subleasing or taking over a lease don&#39;t do it they don&#39;t know what they are doing. I talked to a lawyer who consulted them on their lease and the lawyer said that the people who work there are completely lost.<br><br>All the other reviews are true if I could give this place 0 stars I would. They try to rip you off at every corner. Just signing a lease there are a million &#34;fees&#34; to cover &#34;extra processing work&#34; when I see the staff sitting on their asses everyday. <br><br>UPDATE: I lost thousands of dollars because management ultimately was not willing to give my subleaser the room I had showed her (my room), trying to stick her in another random unit where a girl had moved out because the roommate was stealing her stuff. They refused to give my deposit back and charged me more for their loss in rent (even though I had brought a suitable subleaser). I later found out from my old roommate that they moved in another girl (the one getting her stuff stolen) into my spot...so what rent are they losing out on, its not from my room.<br><br>Also, they have their employees write reviews.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-loop-apartments-isla-vista-3,The Loop Apartments,1,"Take every positive review with a grain of salt, as they give residents gift cards for leaving reviews. The Loop is overpriced and management is awful and completely apathetic. I lived there for two years, and in that time we have dealt with multiple floods from floors above, resulting in our walls and ceiling being opened up multiple times and our items getting damaged. The elevator frequently breaks, and people have been stuck unable to open the doors. Theft is common, we have had clothing stolen from the laundry room multiple times, and even items off of our door decorations, and a friend of mine had his speaker stolen. When I reported the thefts, they said there was nothing they could do about the clothing, as there are no cameras in the laundry room, and that they couldn&#39;t tell us who stole our door decorations (EVEN THOUGH THEY KNEW WHO IT WAS) because they didn&#39;t want to start issues between residents. They forced a new tenant into our room during the pandemic, even though my roommate was high risk (this new tenant made it clear she was unwilling to follow covid protocol, and management upon learning this essentially told us the only thing we could do to prevent them from moving her in was to pay an extra $1420/month in addition to the combined $3000/month we were already paying). I will say that Luis, who is in charge of maintenance, is awesome. He&#39;s friendly, and is quick to take care of maintenance requests. The roof is also great. Just don&#39;t move in expecting any kind of respect from management, because they make it abundantly clear that all they want is your money and they do not care about the resident&#39;s well-being. We have been lied to by the building&#39;s manager multiple times, and they very clearly try to take advantage of college kids who do not know better. Other things to be aware of, parking spots are limited and go quickly, and cost $200/month, and do not fit longer cars. There is also a $200/month fee for pets. Laundry costs around $1.50 per wash and about the same per drying cycle, but count on at least one washing machine and one dryer being broken, and having to dry your clothes twice as the dryers are not very powerful.",,,21,"Natalie, thank you for your feedback.

The management is horrible, it is extremely over priced for a &#34;single bedroom&#34; that is separated by half a wall, so basically you have a double for 1.4k a month EACH PERSON. The security is non existent. My roommate&#39;s laptop was stolen from our apartment and management claimed the security cameras were &#34;off because they were upgrading.&#34; Every time I had an issue they would take MONTHS to fix it. I would have to email over 5 times for them to not solve anything until I moved out. In other words DO NOT LIVE HERE.",,,21,"Hi Evelyn, I am sorry you did not enjoy your living experience at The Loop. We are under new management as of May 2018 and we are striving to make The Loop a the best in IV with a lot of changes coming your way. I have contacted you couple of weeks ago regarding your ledger and if you have any other questions, you are welcome to call us at (805) 328-5007.

They were able to get me into the room I wanted close to the price I wanted. The prices are not the cheapest, but it&#39;s California. Everything is expensive. My only complaint is that they nickel and dime you with the washer and dryers. The management is great! They are respectful and kind. I enjoy the location and peace that the Loop offers.",,,21,"Hi Connor! We are happy we were able to find you housing for the Fall term! Thank you for your review Connor.
